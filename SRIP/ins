About the Simulator:
	The left pane has settings you might need to change.
		The frequency input changes the frequency of the oscillator named as OSC on the simulation panel
		The show module checkboxes are to show you the expected output of your circuit, please try to replicate that.
		Click on save settings to save your settings, and click on clear to remove all settings.
			-Warning, when you click on save settings or clear settings, your circuit gets cleared automatically, so please choose your settings before hand.

		If you get stuck, and are not able to make the counter, the load counter and load ring counter buttons will help you out.
		To clear the simulation, click on the clear workspace button

	The right pane contains the workspace where you will simulate your experiment.
		The panel on the left contains the pre-made logic circuits you will require to build a counter.
			In case you want to build a Flip-Flop, please open the Flip-Flop experiment page.
		Drag them on the right, to place them on your breadboard.
		The left side contains the inputs, and the right side the outputs.
		Click on the circle of the input or output to another input/output to draw a line.
		You can connect only one line to an input, but an output can have multiple lines.

		The DC icon outputs digital 1 at all times, connnect it to 
			-push on: to simulate the 1 only when you're pressing on the button
			-push off: to simulate 0 when you're pushing the button
			-toggle: to toggle the output between 1 and 0.

		The OSC supplies 1 and 0 in a specific frequency which you set in the settings pane.

		The joint icon is just a connection, to make your connections look neater, as the lines from an output to an input are straight.

		Next are flip-flops which work as you'd expect them to.

		The DSO displays the output in a graph format for easy verification. It has 8 inputs, you can choose to use any number of them. If you want more, just drag drop more of them.
